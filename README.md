## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

  Install the Gatsby CLI
  ```shell
  npm i -g gatsby-cli
  ```

  You will also need to create a .env.development and .env.production in the root folder, and add the variable EMAILJS_ID, as well as
  changing the parameters for the emailjs.send() function in  src/components/Contact.tsx to your own.

  Check out <a href='https://www.emailjs.com/'>emailjs</a> for more info.

  

  Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

  ```shell
  cd markbaydoun-portfolio/

  gatsby develop
  ```

  Site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
