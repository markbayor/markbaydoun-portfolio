          I'm a Junior Software Engineer based in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫, in the province of Barcelona, Spain. I enrolled to Fullstack Academy's Immersive Program
          after a roommate from my time in New York introduced me to software engineering.
          I keep improving all the time, so I look forward to the next challenges that come.
