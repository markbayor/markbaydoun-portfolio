          I'm a Junior Software Engineer based in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫, in the province of Barcelona, Spain. A roommate from my time in New York in 2019-2020 introduced me to software engineering, and I enrolled to Fullstack Academy's Immersive Program.
          After a very (VERY) intensive period, I've improved my skills more than I ever imagined. I'm always looking for the next challenge.
