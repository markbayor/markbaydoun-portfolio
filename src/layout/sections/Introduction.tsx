          I'm a Junior Software Engineer based in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫, in the province of Barcelona, Spain. I enrolled to Fullstack Academy's Immersive Program
          after a roommate from my time in New York introduced me to software engineering.
          I've honed and developed my skills a lot since then, and am looking for the next challenge/s to do so even more.
