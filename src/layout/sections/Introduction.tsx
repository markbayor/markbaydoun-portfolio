          I'm a Junior Software Engineer based in Vilanova i la Geltrú, in the province of Barcelona, Spain. I enrolled to Fullstack Academy's Immersive Program
          after a roommate from my time in New York introduced me to software engineering. I am passionate about software design, and love to work on innovative
          projects and products.
